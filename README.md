---

### **Step 1: Create Your Component Locally**

1.  **Fork the Repository**

    - Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page to create your own copy of this project.

2.  **Clone Your Fork**

    - Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Hacktoberfest2025.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Hacktoberfest2025.git)
    cd Hacktoberfest2025
    ```

3.  **Choose a Component and Create Your Folder**

    - Navigate to the `projects` directory.
    - Choose a category you'd like to contribute to (e.g., `buttons`, `loaders`, `checkboxes`).
    - Inside the chosen category folder, create a **new folder named with your GitHub username**. (e.g., `projects/buttons/withaarzoo`).

4.  **Set Up the File Structure**

    - Inside your `[your_username]` folder, create the following file structure:

    ```
    your_username/
    â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ images/
    â”œâ”€â”€ css/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ style.css
    â”œâ”€â”€ js/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.js
    â””â”€â”€ index.html
    ```

5.  **Build Your Component**
    - Now, get creative! Code your unique UI component within the files you just created. Make sure it's a self-contained project that runs from your `index.html`.

### **Step 2: Deploy Your Component to Netlify**

To showcase your work, you need to deploy **only your component's folder** to Netlify.

1.  **Log in to Netlify:**

    - Go to [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/) and log in or sign up.

2.  **Deploy Manually:**

    - From your Netlify dashboard, click on **"Add new site"** and select **"Deploy manually"**.
    - Drag and drop your **username folder** (e.g., the `withaarzoo` folder, not the entire `Hacktoberfest2025` project) into the upload area.

3.  **Configure Your Site:**
    - Once uploaded, go to the site settings. Click **"Change site name"** and give your project a unique and memorable name.
    - Copy the live URL of your project (e.g., `your-project-name.netlify.app`).

### **Step 3: Add Your Details and Create a Pull Request**

1.  **Update `contributors.json`:**

    - Open the `contributors.json` file in the root of the main project.
    - Add a new JSON object with your details. Make sure to add a comma `,` after the previous entry if necessary.

    **Example format:**

    ```json
    {
      "name": "Your Name",
      "occupation": "Your Occupation (e.g., Web Developer)",
      "place": "Your City, Country",
      "bio": "A short, fun bio about yourself!",
      "github_profile_url": "[https://github.com/your_username](https://github.com/your_username)",
      "project_netlify_link": "[https://your-project-name.netlify.app](https://your-project-name.netlify.app)"
    }
    ```

2.  **Commit and Push Your Changes:**

    - Add your changes to git and push them to your forked repository.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add [Your Component Name] by [Your Username]"
    git push origin main
    ```

3.  **Open a Pull Request:**
    - Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click the **"Contribute"** button, then **"Open pull request"**.
    - Provide a clear title and description for your pull request.
    - Wait for your PR to be reviewed and merged.

    **Important Note:** Please add your data object at the **end of the list** inside the `contributors.json` file. Do not add your details in the middle or at the beginning of the file. Your new entry should be placed after the last existing entry, separated by a comma.

    For example:

    ```txt
    [
        ...
        {
            // some one else's data
        },
        {
            // Add your data object here
        }
    ]
    ```
